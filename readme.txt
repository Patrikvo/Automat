Future:

- bedrijfseenheid (sp: SW)
- beveiliging wissen
- Toon archief meer naar voor plaatsen
- candidates (name, ond, contactname, email, total price, def. total price)
- Financial info. (raming)

- Form manager (dispatcher)


- send-email-button for contactpersons.

- generate documents

- states (active, on hold, archived)

-- controller per tabpage?

Note: new DB column should be nullable to make migration easier. (prevents the need to alter the SQL insert statements).

Current:

IT_004

features: 
- phases + dates
- dates and info during CBS-process

- fix: added comfirmation before deleting (undo?)


++ Add modifying and deleting of Tasks
++ fix refresh of tasklist after write





Fix:

- better migration support.
Migration support  (import older DB)
after changing models and adding to dossierContext (public DbSet<Model.DossierPerson> dossierPersoon { get; set; })
Using Db Browser export database to SQL 
remove migrations (everything)
remove database.db (source map)
apply 'Add-Migration initial' and 'Update-Database'
Using Db Browser import sql to database (issue: need someway to add non-nullable fields)

- field "Archived" (implemented)

- link to files  (field exist in DB, code needs to be added to the application.)
UI: contains the base directory, needs the part to split up the dossiernummer in year and nummer.
